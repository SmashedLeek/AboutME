# AboutMe
My name is Matthew Lewis
# My college experience is limitied as this is only my third semester going so far.
My computer experience is mainly windows with some in linux. I have done scripting in javascript some C# and now im learning *python*.
**I am in this class for many reasons mainly because i want to learn the python language and the other is that it is a requirement for my AA in Cyber Security**.
The only draw back i can see in this class is that i do have a family that may mean some of my projects or assignments may be a lil rushed or late but i will do my best to keep on top of everything that this class requires.
The most important thing in my life is my family and showing my kids that even at my age school and a good education is very important.
Something interesting about me? I would have to say that i am a great listenerer and always willing to learn from someone else's view.
